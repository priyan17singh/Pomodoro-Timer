# ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer - Python Project

The **Pomodoro Timer** is a time management tool built with Python and Tkinter based on the Pomodoro Technique. It helps you boost productivity by alternating focused work sessions with short and long breaks. This version includes a dynamic window behavior that positions the timer **at the bottom of the screen during work sessions** and brings it **to the front during breaks**, helping reduce distractions and keeping your workflow optimal.
